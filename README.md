### TheJackForge - Creating change through code and positivity

<p>Hello, my name is Jack and I am a web developer from Alberta, Canada. Right now, my main focus is to learn as much as I can in order to find a Junior Developer position. If you would like to chat, please send me a message on here, or find me on Twitter at <a href="http://www.twitter.com/TheJackForge">@TheJackForge</a>.</p>

<h2>Current Projects</h2>
<p>I enjoy creating things that help and educate others. I have just finished a few JavaScript courses and my new focus is creating a learning platform for those that are looking to learn JavaScript. This will mostly revolve around basic concepts that will not only help others, but will give me a chance to showcase some of my JavaScript skills.</p>
